ABOUT:
------

This code provides the simulation of mitotic spindle elements (for now, the
kinetochore and the spindle pole bodies), during cell division in
fission yeast. 

The underlying model is fully described in: 

Gay et al. 'A stochastic model of kinetochoreâ€“microtubule attachment
accurately describes fission yeast chromosome segregation'

LICENCE:
--------

This code is provided under the GPL compatible CeCILL licence (see
LICENCE.txt for full details).

INSTALLATION:
-------------

You should first clone the github version of this code, then
use the setup script, whether via:

# python setup.py build 

for a local install, or 

# python setup.py install 

for a system install.
You will need a C compiler for the cython part.


USAGE:
------

>>> import kt_simul.simul_spindle as sim
>>> metaph = sim.Metaphase()
>>> metaph.simul()
>>> metaph.show_one()
>>> help(metaph)

Should provide a first view of the simulation. 

Using the GUI:

# python [path_to_package]/kt_smul/gui/kineto_simulation.py
