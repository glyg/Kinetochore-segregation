ABOUT:
~~~~~~~
This python module provides the simulation of mitotic spindle elements (for now, the
kinetochore and the spindle pole bodies), during cell division in
fission yeast.

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should first clone the github version of this code, then
use the setup script, whether via:

  # python setup.py build

for a local install, or
  
  # python setup.py install

for a system install.
You will need a C compiler for the cython part.

USAGE:
~~~~~
 
>>> import kt_simul.simul_spindle as sim
>>> metaph = sim.Metaphase()
>>> metaph.simul()
>>> metaph.show_one()
>>> help(metaph)

Should provide a first view of the simulation.
Using the GUI:

    # python [path_to_package]/kt_smul/gui/kineto_simulation.py

Further details can be found by looking at the code.
